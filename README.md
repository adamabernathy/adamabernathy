# Hello!

I'm a Salt Lake City, Utah based software engineering and data consultant. With nearly 20 years of experience in applied digital technologies, computational physics and operational management, I've served in several roles from director of a forecast office, research associate to a principal engineer in several mission critical roles at various companies.

Currently, working at Heartland Dental as a senior software engineer and project manager designing and managing the development of highly scalable next-generation digital marketing and data automation products. As a consultant working with local businesses and startups helping them digitally transform to improve their internal workflows and save money along the way.

I'd like to think I know where all the good tacos and cold beer are here in town.
